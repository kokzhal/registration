Dorm Registration app
Our Suleyman Demirel University dormitory automation project includes a backend part written in Java using Spring Boot.

The backend is a RESTful API that processes requests sent by the user from the frontend of the project.

This project uses the following technologies and tools:
- Java 11
-Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- maven

RESTful API provides the ability to interact with the PostgreSQL database, which stores information about students who are settled in a hostel.
The system provides the possibility of registering students, as well as viewing information about occupied students and vacant rooms.

The entire backend part of the project is available for viewing and downloading on GitHub.
